## Spectre.modular.css
 A fork of [Spectre.css](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre) that takes advantage of the new [Sass module system](https://sass-lang.com/blog/the-module-system-is-launched).

 The only reason to use this is if you want to import the *.scss files into your own project through NPM and you want to use the new Sass module system. For minified CSS files, use the ones from the upstream project.
